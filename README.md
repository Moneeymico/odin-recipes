# odin-recipes
A project for the odin project. A project that will allow me to use begginer techniques within VScode using HTML techniques that i have learnt through out the course. I will have to demonstrate HTML at its begginer level for example creating paragraphs lists and even a template of how html has to be started.


I will also have to show good housekeeping for example neat file location and conisistent git commit messages.
